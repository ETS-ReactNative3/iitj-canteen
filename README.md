A mobile-application which takes care of orders, payments, queues, and delivery, for any food vendor.

- Integrating Payment SDKs

> **Note**: This project is yet to be inserted in the tender for canteen/food truck.

##### Proposed Tech. Stack
- MERN `MongoDB, ExpressJS, NodeJS, ReactJS`
> ReactJS is chosen so we can then use its components for further developing a cross-platform mobile application in react native.

## Steps to setup locally and run:
If you run into any errors , refer to the Environment setup on the official React Native Docs - [Environment-Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

* ### Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/)
> Deploying this app requires node package manager `npm` 

* ### Clone the repository
> Download this repository `or`
```
git clone https://github.com/pclubiitj/iitj-canteen.git
cd iitj-canteen
```
* ### Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
> Yarn is a dependency manager built by facebook and google. It is a more efficient and reliable (thanks to yarn.lock) alternative of npm.
- Launch ``` yarn ``` command in a terminal opened in the project folder.
> This command will look into the *package.json* file and install all the dependencies listed here.
- Install react-native-cli globally on your computer
```
yarn global add react-native-cli
```
#### Android steps

- Launch a virtual android device, for instance, by using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html#viewing)

> If you have never installed any android virtual device, [follow those instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds.html#createavd)

* ### Start the project with
```
react-native start
```
* ### Run `debug build`
```
react-native run-android
```
